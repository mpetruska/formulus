The application is available at:
[https://mpetruska.github.io/formulus/](https://mpetruska.github.io/formulus/)  
(by the courtesy of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/))

This project is created for the purpose of helping you creating
simple shareable calculations (and not only because the humble
author enjoys working with [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/)).

Creating calculations
---------------------

Only the four basic mathematical operations (and parentheses) are
recognized by the formula parser at the moment.

How to share your calculations
------------------------------

Once your worksheet is ready all the components that make up the
calculation (inputs and calculations) are encoded in the fragment
identifier of the url (e.g. #!...). All you need to do is to copy
or bookmark the whole url (e.g. ...), opening the link in a browser
makes the application re-load the worksheet. Be aware that the
current values of the input fields are also encoded.
